A colorful calculator I built while learning Python and Tkinter! 😊  

## 🔧 What's New?

  - If you try to divide by zero → Shows "Error: Div by 0"  
  - If you type letters → Shows "Error"  
- **Pretty new look!** 🎨  
  - Dark mode (like your phone at night)  
  - Orange buttons for math symbols (+ - × ÷)  
  - Bigger, easier-to-read text  
- **Decimal numbers work now!** 🔢  
  - Can do math like `3.5 + 2.1`  
  - "." button won't let you add two dots (like "5..2")
